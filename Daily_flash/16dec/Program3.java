/*

Ovierriding allows the Derived class to provide specific implementation of those method which are already present in the Parent class
If we want to override a method in the sub class than the method in the sub class should have same return type, parameter and name as that
of in the parent class.

Overiding is used so that a derived class can access the parent class method if it wants and make changes if required.

Main method cannot be overriden as it is static, and in java we cannot override static methods...also as main is method from where jvm starts its execution, hence it will be confusing for jvm to understand that from where exactly it should start,hence it creates ambiguity.
